# Page structure — Home

The build spec. Figma gives a flat mockup; this file is the semantic plan that
replaces it. Follow this rather than transcribing Figma coordinates.

## Why the Figma output can't be used directly

`get_design_context` on `Desktop Home` returned:

```
absolute-positioned elements : 336
flex containers              :  91
grid containers              :   0
semantic tags (section/h1/…) :   0
```

The frame was created by wrapping loose, scattered layers, so Figma had no
auto-layout to infer from and emitted fixed pixel coordinates at 1921px wide.
Shipping that would mean a non-responsive page with no landmarks — a direct
violation of the SEO rules in CLAUDE.md. Use it for **colour, imagery and
proportion only**.

## Document outline

Exactly one `<h1>`. Every section is a `<section>` with an accessible name.

```
<header>            site nav + primary CTA
<main>
  <section>  hero            → h1 "Your Path to $100M."
  <section>  social proof    → h2 (visually hidden if needed)
  <section>  creatives       → h2 "Want Creatives This Premium?"
  <section>  case studies    → h2 "Not Just Pretty, but Profitable."
  <section>  testimonials    → h2 "Reputation is everything. Ours is flawless."
  <section>  final CTA       → h2 "You scrolled so far. You want this. Trust us."
</main>
<footer>            email capture, link columns, socials
```

Heading levels must not skip. Card titles inside a section are `<h3>`.

## Section notes

**Header** — sticky. Links: Agency, Case Studies, Templates. `Book a Call` is
the primary CTA (`--accent-purple`, pill radius 100px). Mobile: hamburger.

**Hero** — the only eager-loaded imagery on the page. Headline at 80px desktop,
scaling down on mobile. Floating proof chips are decorative; mark them
`aria-hidden` if they duplicate content, otherwise give them real text.

**Social proof** — brand logotypes (SVG, in `public/images/`) plus the line
"110+ brands enhanced their ads with Mushi". Logos are `<img>` with explicit
dimensions, not CSS backgrounds, so they stay in the accessibility tree.

**Creatives** — horizontally scrollable card row with prev/next controls.
Must work without JS for the static export: use CSS scroll-snap and progressive
enhancement. Do **not** reach for a carousel library.

**Case studies** — 2×2 grid on desktop, single column on mobile. Each card:
screenshot, result line, tag chips (radius 5px). Three of the four brands are
unconfirmed — see COPY.md.

**Testimonials** — masonry-ish grid of quote cards. Each: title, 5 stars,
body, date · name · country. "View More" reveals the rest; keep all items in
the DOM so they are crawlable, and toggle with CSS/details rather than fetching.

**Final CTA** — full-width panel with purple gradient. Repeats the fit-check
CTA and the scarcity line.

**Footer** — email capture posts to a **third-party email provider**. There is
no server and no API route. Until the provider is chosen, render the form
disabled or link out; never point it at a local endpoint.

## Non-negotiables from CLAUDE.md

- `output: 'export'` — no server. No API routes, route handlers, server
  actions, `middleware.ts`/`proxy.ts`, `getServerSideProps`, ISR, or Supabase.
- next/image optimization is **off**. Every image needs explicit `width` and
  `height`, WebP source, `loading="lazy"` below the fold, `loading="eager"` +
  `fetchPriority="high"` for the hero.
- `metadata` export with **absolute** OG image URLs.
- JSON-LD: Organization + WebSite.
- `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts`.

## Still to do

- [ ] Confirm the three unnamed case-study brands
- [ ] Client logo SVGs — Holo's wordmark is live text in Figma, not an asset
- [ ] Choose the email provider for the footer capture
- [ ] Mobile artboard was not pulled from Figma — verify breakpoints by eye
- [ ] Rename assets from machine names as sections are built
